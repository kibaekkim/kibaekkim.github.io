I am a Computational Mathematician in [Laboratory for Applied Mathematics, Numerical Software, and Statistics](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/lans), [Mathematics and Computer Science Division](https://www.anl.gov/mcs) at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov), and a Senior Scientist at-Large at [the University of Chicago Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering](https://researchinnovation.uchicago.edu/research-support/case/). My primary research focus is on optimization modeling and solutions for large-scale optimization (in particular, stochastic optimization and distributed optimization) capable of running on high performance computing systems, in applications to complex energy systems and distributed learning. Before joining Argonne, I obtained a Ph.D. degree in Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences from Northwestern University. I am a recipient of DOE Early Career Research Program award.
